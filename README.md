# UC Berkeley Extension - Data Structures and Algorithms Class 

A collection of classes and functions for use in UC Berkeley Extension's Comp Sci X404.1: Data Structures and Algorithms Class.

This package is designed as an educational tool for students to learn and experiment with data structures and algorithms.
It is written in Python with an emphasis on readability and clarity, rather than performance or optimization.
Not intended for production use.

# Revision History
## 2025.12.24
* Added from_dict() import methods to Graph classes
* Added more quick start documentation for the main data structures
* Thank you for your work, Rishab!

## 2025.12.9
* Renamed class dijkstras to dijkstra
* Cleaned up graph bugs and added adjacent_items() for weighted graphs (vertex and weight) pair
* adjacents() now returns a list of adjacent vertices only 

## 2025.12.8
* Created Graph Factory class 
* Major revisions to Graph class
  * Added and modified methods to Graph classes to take advantage of inheritance and follow CLRS closely
     * graph now has is_directed and is_weighted members (both default to False)
     * added size() - # of edges and order() -- # of vertices
     * added delete_vertex(), has_vertex() and get_weight()
     * renamed is_edge() to has_edge()
     * add_edge() now automatically adds directed or undirected edge based on the type graph type
  * Added graph_traversal module (moved all DFS and BFS methods to this module)   
  * Any graph object now works on any graph algorithm
* Graph Draw now reads weighted and directed properties from graph object
* SinglyLinkedList and DoublyLinkedList now implements search and insert_after(). Removed insert() with index
* DoublyLinkedList now inherits from SinglyLinkedList and implements only methods that affect the contents of the list

## 2025.11.27
* Made sure that both vertices in add_edge() are included in the internal representation for the Adjacency List
* Adjacency Matrix self-loop vertices are now set to none
* Added to_dict() methods for Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix classes
* Added is_weighted member for Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix classes

## 2025.11.13
* Fixed Dijkstra’s algorithm implementation (shortest_path) to align with lecture slides
* Added contains method (in operator) to both Graph implementations for vertex existence checks
* Updated tests accordingly

## 2025.09.12
* Fixed bug when initial list is greater than 10 for Array, CircularArray and DynamicArray constructors

## 2025.09.02
* Added Hash Set 
* Added data structure generators (not fully tested)
* Added equality testing for array, stack, queue, deque, linkedlist and heap classes
* Renamed Hashtable delete() to remove()
* Updated Dijkstra's algorithm implementation to follow lecture more closely

## 2025.07.17
* Added generators module -- functions to generate linear and random arrays, queues, stacks, tries, heaps, trees and graphs (warning: a work in progress)
* Hashtable updates
  * Allow non-strings for keys
  * Works with index operator [] and in operator
  * Added pop() method (thank you, Rishab!)
* Cleaned up some test cases (singly linked list, doubly linked list, stack, queue, hash table)

## 2025.07.05
* Added two new functions to sorttools: array_details() - returns the length, and the contents of an array/list  and generate_almost_sorted_array() 

## 2025.06.25
* Added boundary checking for shift_left() and shift_right() Array methods. Also, changed to accept only one argument starting argument. (Thanks for reporting this, Alejandro!)
  
## 2025.06.14
* Added iterative versions of insert and delete BST methods 

## 2025.06.11
* Revised Trie Draw to draw circles instead of squares

## 2025.3.22
* Added CircularArray and CircularQueue classes
* SinglyLinkedList and DoublyLinkedList classes
  * Added separate delete_head() and delete_tail() methods
  * Changed behavior insert() so if index == count, performs an append()
* Changed behavior insert() in Array class so if index == count, performs an append()
* Queue and Heap classes
  * Refactored to_list() to raw_view()
