✅ Recommended Left Navigation (Slim + Classroom-Focused)

2. Core Structures

Only the structures you actually use in class.

For example:

2.1 Array
	•	Purpose
	•	Key Operations (short list)
	•	Simple Example
	•	API Reference (autogenerated)

2.2 Graph
	•	Purpose
	•	Creating Graphs
	•	Key Operations (add, has_edge, adjacents…)
	•	API Reference

(Include other structures only if they appear in your course.)

⸻

3. Usage Guides

Short, task-driven guides — not full lessons.
	•	How to Create Arrays
	•	How to Build a Graph
	•	How to Traverse a Structure
	•	Common Errors

Each should be 1–2 screens max.

⸻

4. Assignments Support
	•	Starter Code Snippets
	•	Tips for Debugging
	•	Typical Pitfalls

(Students love this section.)

⸻

5. API Reference

Autogenerated. No teaching, just signatures + parameters.

⸻

6. Changelog

Short and simple.

⸻

🎯 Why this works well
	•	You avoid teaching full data structures here.
	•	Students learn concepts in class, and the docs strictly support implementation.
	•	It keeps the site clean, compact, and easy to navigate.
	•	It prevents you from maintaining long tutorials.
	•	It acts like a “class companion,” not a textbook.

⸻

If you want, I can produce a final recommended structure, written in the exact format for MkDocs (mkdocs.yml) or Sphinx (toctree) depending on what you use.



Here’s a clean, well-structured left-navigation menu for dsa_package. It’s optimized for clarity, beginner-friendliness, and quick access to what students need most.

This structure works whether you use MkDocs, Sphinx, or another static site generator.

🎯 Why this works well
	•	Beginners can stay in Tutorials/Examples.
	•	Intermediate students look in Data Structures.
	•	Advanced users jump to API Reference.
	•	Clear separation between explanations, examples, and technical API.
	•	Minimal clicks to reach what they care about (graphs, arrays, etc.).

⸻

If you want, I can generate the exact YAML config for MkDocs or the Sphinx sidebar structure for this menu.




⸻

✅ What you already have (and what’s good)
	•	You provide an API reference listing the modules / classes / methods.
	•	The docs are hosted and publicly available online.

That’s already a solid starting point.

⸻

🛠 What could make the documentation significantly better

• Provide a “Getting Started” or Quick-Start guide

Right now you have reference-style docs, but many users benefit from a short tutorial that shows how to: install the package, create a simple array or graph, run a basic operation. This helps new users get going quickly.  ￼

• Add clear, runnable code examples for each major class / method

For every public class or method, include at least one concrete code snippet showing common usage. Example-centric docs help readers understand intent, not just API signatures.  ￼

• Structure the documentation in layered form: overview → tutorial → reference → “advanced use / edge cases / gotchas”

A layered structure helps both beginners and advanced users: novices can stay in tutorials, power users skip to reference.  ￼

• Explain not just what methods do — but why and when to use them

Adding rationale/context helps users make good decisions. For example: when would one choose an adjacency list vs adjacency matrix, or when an array from dsa_package makes sense over Python’s built-in list.  ￼

• Include versioning / changelog information

As the library evolves, document what changed, when, and how it affects usage (e.g. deprecated methods, behavior changes). This helps developers stay aligned.  ￼

• Add troubleshooting, common pitfalls, and FAQs

Real users often get stuck — a section documenting typical mistakes, boundary conditions, common bugs (e.g. index out-of-range, misuse of weighted vs unweighted graph) helps reduce confusion and support burden.  ￼

• Use a consistent, clean writing style and formatting

Prefer clear, concise sentences; avoid jargon or unexplained assumptions. Use consistent terminology across the docs. Use headings, bullet lists, and tables when appropriate so information is easy to scan.  ￼

• Consider automation or documentation‐generation tools (or at least doc-string synchronization)

If the code changes often, docs tend to lag behind. Using a system (or process) for keeping docs automatically in sync with code can help prevent inaccuracies.  ￼

🎯 What I’d do if I were you (given your context as instructor / educator)

Because you’re teaching data-structures, documentation for dsa_package should aim to be both reference and learning material. Here’s what I’d prioritize:
	1.	Quick-start guide showing: install, import, create array/graph, simple operations.
	2.	Tutorials for common data-structures (array, graph, etc.) including short, commented code.
	3.	Comparison notes & design rationale — e.g. array vs Python list; adjacency list vs adjacency matrix — to teach trade-offs, not just API.
	4.	Edge-cases and typical student pitfalls (off-by-one, directed vs undirected graphs, modifications vs in-place).
	5.	Changelog & versioning history, so if you evolve the package, students know what changed.
	6.	Consistent style and readability, so docs are friendly to learners with varying backgrounds (fresh students, returning learners, etc.).

⸻

If you like — I can sketch a new documentation outline for dsa_package (table of contents + section headings + short description) based on those improvements. That might make it easier for you to restructure the docs.
Do you want me to build that outline now?
